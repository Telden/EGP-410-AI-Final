In a mythical land, known only as
"Greg Bemis's Game History class"
Four heros were bestowed the task
To make a game in hopes to pass

The game was unfinished
But the assets remain
Now our only hope:
New heros take the reigns

Continue my legacy
Finish the game
Use the art
That caused Wilson pain

I will die happy

In loving memory of Lucien Szurley
May he rip in peace
